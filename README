In this lab, you will be given a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability; the task is to develop a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and finally gain the root privilege. In addition to the attacks, you will be guided through several protection schemes that have been implemented in the operating system to counter against buffer-overflow attacks. You need to evaluate whether the schemes work or not and explain why.
